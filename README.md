# Sorting-Algorithm-Visualiser
Sorting Visualiser made with tkinter 

A python project that uses tkinter to create an interface to generate arrays and implement various sorting algorithms to sort the data.

Learned how to write 
- Bubble Sort 
- Insertion Sort
- Quick Sort
- Merge Sort 

Learned about different sorting algorithms and time complexities, O(n^2) for Bubble and Insertion Sort and O(nlogn) for Quick and Merge Sort. 
Learned how to make simple GUI with tkinter
